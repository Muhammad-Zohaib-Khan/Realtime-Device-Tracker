I recently worked on a MERN stack project that includes:

🔹 Real-Time Device Tracking using Leaflet & Socket.io 📍

🔹 Dynamic Welcome Animation 🎉

🔹 User Form (Name, Email, Image Upload) 📄

🔹 Profile Display & CRUD Operations ✏️❌

This project helped me improve my skills in real-time data handling, state management, and backend integration.
